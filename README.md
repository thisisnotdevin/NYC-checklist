## Description of the project:
Many people struggle to find places to go out, places to eat, and find the "top things to do in NYC" to be oversaturated. The project is a website that allows visitors and locals to find anything in New York City, from enjoyable activities to top-notch restaurants and rooftop bars. Hidden gems that nobody has talked about. The website has a sign-in system, allowing each user to have their own account. On our website, we'll have personalized preferences for various users, allowing each one to see recommendations based on their prior preferences. This website aids those who are having trouble choosing a destination or finding things to do.
## Objective:
Besides all the famous places like the Statue of Liberty and Broadway, it can be difficult to find what you're looking for. Our website can assist both tourists and locals to find the perfect activities.

Example: Your friends from Canada visit you for the summer, and you want to take them out to a fun place in NYC. However, they have already visited all the well-known locations, including Broadway, Times Square, and the Statue of Liberty. When you search for "top things to do in New York City," they all direct you to the same crowded tourist spots, despite the fact that you want to take them somewhere new. Our website will show unique places that allow the user to easily pick activities to do.

## Meetings weekly:
Mondays 9:00 pm
Wednesdays 9:00 pm
Fridays 9:00 pm

## Project details:
### What is the goal?
Because New York City is such a touristic destination, the popular places are often crowded with tourists, and locals have a difficult time finding places to go because there are so few options online when searching for things to do in New York City. We want to create this website so that we can assist both locals and tourists in visiting unusual places that are fun and inexpensive. Our website is created to save individuals time when determining where to go, whether to eat, have fun, or go out with friends or family. 

### What are some of the features?
The ability to display special events that are now and will occur in the future is one unique feature of our website. That option is not available on other websites like TripAdvisor and Yelp. Furthermore, New York City frequently hosts events that are only temporary for a week, such as Japanese festivals, carnivals, comic cons, and many other events occur just for a few days, and those who are unaware of these may miss out on a fantastic opportunity to view these attractions. Our website will immediately update any new events that occur so that no one misses out on any of them. 

### What challenges will we solve? / how did we improve the system?
One of the main issues with teenagers is that they struggle to find events to attend, whether they are with friends or family. Moreover, they want more information than simply the location or event's name; they want to know what will be there, what will be available nearby, how much it will cost, etc., thus we want to provide them a concise description so they will know what to anticipate.

### Who is our audience and how will it benefit them?
The audience for our website could be anybody ages ranging from 8-65 (this is an estimate). This means that our design and functions must be simple and understandable to any 8 year old or 65 year old, once we cover those two ranges, it should be easily understandable to anybody in between. Additionally, not everybody will be from NYC; We have to provide them information on how to access transportation, places to avoid when busy, etc. 
Besides helping tourists, our website is also designed to help people that live in New York City. Many people often struggle to find a place to go out with their friends or a date, many activities that they have seen or heard about but don‚Äôt know where it is or if it is even still there. One more important benefit is that it will be able to show future events so people can plan according to their schedule.

### How will this website be built?
Language
The website will use HTML to construct and display the web browser, CSS to add design and style to the HTML pages, and Javascript as the central component to connect and create all of the website's features. For user functions and data storage, we will also PHP and SQL as additional languages. However, we are still choosing to test out new building blocks like React JS or backend storage like Firebase based on our time constraints.

### Schedule & Work
We determined that it is most efficient and beneficial to set out a few hours a week to have a group meeting and talk about our process and keep ourselves updated because the members of our group have widely different schedules, some people have work while others have classes. In addition, members work independently to contribute to this project; all modifications are logged on an open-access Google doc.
Since our group members have different skills and strengths in different sectors of computer science, we are discussing the most optimal way to divide work. The member with the most experience with a certain process will work on that part, and work is divided among others the same way.

### Data, Information, News
There are many sources for news, events, restaurants, activities in NYC, our team will focus on specific ones that have the most accurate information. Sources can come from other websites, news, instagram posts, and many more. Making sure to design a system that only displays events once is important because we run the risk of receiving duplicate events when gathering data from various sources and posting them twice on the website. 
	Our initial task for this section is to find the most efficient way to gather data from other places, perhaps some fetching API, or web scraping from a website. In the future, our team will research if there is a more efficient way of doing this process.

### Design
Our UI (user interface) which are all the visual elements are going to be very simplistic. We believe that making it simple can also be visually appealing to the users and also less work on our end. That includes easy to read text and clear navigation buttons. Speed is important because our website should not be slow, we have to design it so it can handle a large traffic of users and information coming and going, however this task is for the future. We also need to make sure to use a secure database that keeps user information safe, users should not be able to access other people‚Äôs information through our website.
Useful website for the figures https://undraw.co/illustrations quality illustrations available for our designs with customisable color(s), objects that can be combined and modified to create new exciting images and with a design style that balances art and tech to our website

### Planning
Professional website design can make or break a company. A well-designed website can be a powerful tool for branding, customer engagement, and lead generation. The first impression of your website can impact how potential customers view your business. Is your website accessible on mobile devices? Does it load quickly and appear professional? How user-friendly is it? Will potential customers find what they're looking for? These are all important questions to consider when evaluating the effectiveness of your company's website. Website design may not seem like a very technical field, but there are many considerations when creating a site from scratch or updating an existing one. A poorly designed site can hurt brand recognition, drive visitors away, and send search engine ranking plummeting.

### Team

Projects objectives before the Second Draft:
	Having fully set up a working user sign up and register page, after that will be the board or map of activities and events. It doesn‚Äôt have to be fully functional yet, we will build the interface (HTML & CSS) first, when everything is ready we will implement the javascript part. By this point we should already have the idea of how to gather information for our website and what tools to use. Additionally we should have decided how our page will look like.

## Obstacles and Risks:
### Time 
For now, our team might face time constraints due to many members having work and outside of school activities, we are trying to accommodate enough time to contribute every day.

### Design 
We currently have many designs in mind and we have to choose which one will fit our goal the most. Besides that we also have to have an idea of how to implement it, a design out of our capability will take us too much time. 

### Tasks
Build and design the front website
Create placeholder for the activities, while another teammate researches the best way to implement the API
Search for packages on https://www.npmjs.com/ and install dependencies
Scraping website for events, recently started working on getting events into our website. By using javascript we have libraries that help us do that. Axios visits a url and get the response from it, which is the response data that we can save and use for our HTML. cheerio allows us to pass through all the HTML that we gathered with axios, we can select a class name that we like to pick out and their components such as the picture, title, link, price.
The next step is to display these events into our website
